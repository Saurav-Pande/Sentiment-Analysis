# Word Cloud and EDA-Twitter Airline Sentiment Data
Sentiment analysis is the technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.

The project aims to classify the tweets into a good tweet or a racist/sexist tweet. It is easier to predict rather than making use of human resource to spend their time identify which tweet belongs to what category. The training data already consists of the classified tweets into good and bad with the labels 0 and 1 respectively.

Thus, the model tries to predict the labels of the tweets in the data set.
